WEBVTT

00:44.753 --> 00:46.255
<i>Let's break it down.</i>

00:48.382 --> 00:50.717
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.720
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.014
Sixty-three?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.641
That is a big bite.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.978
<i>-My next step's gotta be oxygen.</i>
<i>-Oxygen, 26 percent.</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.355
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.942
-Carbon, 9 percent.
-Carbon, 9.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.070
-For a total of 98 percent.
-Right.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.533
<i>-Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.</i>
<i>-One-point-two-five.</i>

01:14.700 --> 01:17.035
<i>That brings you to 99 and a quarter.</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:20.205
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

01:20.372 --> 01:22.958
...down where the magic happens.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.920
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.922
<i>Got a whole skeleton to account for.</i>

01:29.088 --> 01:30.799
<i>-You would think, right?</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

01:30.966 --> 01:34.553
<i>Calcium.</i>
<i>Calcium's only 0.25 percent.</i>

01:35.012 --> 01:39.474
What? That low? Seriously?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.393
Damn, I never would've thought that.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.398
-Okay, so where does iron fit in?
-Iron.

01:46.565 --> 01:53.447
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.534
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.579
-Apparently, it don't take much.
-No doubt. Go figure.

02:00.746 --> 02:04.625
<i>-Sodium.</i>
<i>-Sodium, 0.04.</i>

02:06.585 --> 02:11.548
-Phosphorus, 0.19.
-Point-one-nine.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.675
There we go.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.679
So the whole thing...

02:17.846 --> 02:24.353
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

02:26.980 --> 02:32.361
We are 0.111958 percent...

02:33.362 --> 02:34.696
...shy.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.533
-Supposedly, that's everything.
-Yeah?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.703
I don't know, it just....

02:41.870 --> 02:43.121
It just....

02:43.288 --> 02:45.457
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

02:47.959 --> 02:51.713
<i>There's got to be more</i>
<i>to a human being than that.</i>

03:22.411 --> 03:24.079
I hate these shoes.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.998
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

03:27.206 --> 03:29.084
...like I should be squeaking around...

03:29.251 --> 03:31.837
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

03:32.003 --> 03:34.005
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.425
Then why are you wearing them?

03:37.509 --> 03:40.929
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

03:44.099 --> 03:49.771
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.817
I gotta go take this.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.528
Female?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.781
Louis.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.452
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.620
-Just be quick about it.
-No.

04:05.787 --> 04:10.208
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

04:10.375 --> 04:13.170
You can't know how much I hate that.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.970
You missed a spot, right there.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.847
Should you be on that ladder?

04:24.014 --> 04:26.516
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.977
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.355
Yeah, there's an idea.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.360
So I'm working on
this new short story...

04:37.527 --> 04:42.157
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to....

04:43.408 --> 04:45.577
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

04:45.786 --> 04:51.333
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

04:53.168 --> 04:56.087
I mean, you at least tried it.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.008
Come on.

05:01.927 --> 05:06.014
I perhaps tried it. Why?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.517
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.852
Like, changing it in any major way?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.688
It made me more serious.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.524
Really?

05:15.690 --> 05:21.029
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

05:21.822 --> 05:26.034
I was just wondering
if it maybe could....

05:28.870 --> 05:33.375
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.628
-Walter Jr.'s on pot?
-What? No.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.547
No. No.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.258
-What would make you even--?
-Where's he getting it?

05:41.424 --> 05:44.928
-Marie.
-Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

05:45.344 --> 05:49.474
-What are you gonna do about this?
-Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

05:49.641 --> 05:53.562
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

05:54.145 --> 05:58.316
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot...

05:58.483 --> 06:01.403
...certainly not as far as I know.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.072
Not as far as you know?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.116
Marie.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.183
Hey, look at me.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.979
Hey, turn around and look at me.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.362
This.... This here.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.532
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.536
This is degrading.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.917
I'm sorry.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.005
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.258
But I won't.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.885
So either kill me, or let me go.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.723
You don't have it in you, Walter.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.520
How do you know my name?

08:41.896 --> 08:46.067
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.404
I came by to sell you meth.

08:50.739 --> 08:54.075
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.244
Not even close.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.042
What else did he tell you?

09:03.460 --> 09:06.129
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.590
You were his high school teacher.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.800
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

09:10.967 --> 09:13.595
...by making grape soda in class.

09:14.262 --> 09:18.058
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.480
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.857
That partner of yours...

09:26.066 --> 09:27.192
...he's got a big mouth.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.779
Walter...

09:30.945 --> 09:33.448
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

09:33.615 --> 09:35.283
...but trust me...

09:36.076 --> 09:38.620
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.958
So I should just let you go, then.

09:44.125 --> 09:48.671
Just unlock you and...adios, huh?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.633
I don't see
what real choice you have.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.677
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.971
Besides...

09:58.139 --> 10:00.141
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.162
Occupied.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.374
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.668
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

10:29.921 --> 10:32.549
-Okay.
-What the hell, man?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.426
What are you doing, man?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.887
-You asshole. What--?
-You told him my name.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.181
-Says who, him?
-My name, where I work.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.767
-You told him about my son.
-Hey, don't touch me.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.562
-You damn junkie.
-No, give me that. That's mine.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.897
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.607
No, that's worth 40 grand, you--

10:49.774 --> 10:52.527
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.696
Get off the toilet.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.698
-Get off the toilet!
-No.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.870
Get off the toilet.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.289
Stop it.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.043
No. No way.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.829
No.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.998
No, no, no.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.751
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

11:49.918 --> 11:51.294
Back off, man, Jesus.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.962
-We've got work to do.
-No, no.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.673
You got work to do. I did my part.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.343
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

11:58.509 --> 12:01.429
-That is your contribution?
-Kiss my pink ass, man.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.933
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.769
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

12:07.936 --> 12:11.022
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.941
Oh, well, <i>Heil</i> Hitler, bitch.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.443
And let me tell you something else.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.446
We flipped a coin, okay?

12:18.613 --> 12:21.157
You and me. You and me.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.660
Coin flip is sacred.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.464
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement...

12:36.631 --> 12:38.883
...as per the coin.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.635
Fucking do it, already.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.318
That's what she said. Yeah.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.697
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.366
-Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
-Hello?

13:03.574 --> 13:06.035
-Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
-Excuse me.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.662
Do you have these in black?

13:10.081 --> 13:11.833
Anyways, so like I was saying...

13:12.000 --> 13:15.378
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.508
Whatever.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.344
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.014
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:30.476
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

13:30.643 --> 13:35.481
-So I need you to focus, and--
<i>-Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:37.816
Damn it, Hank.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.737
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.821
Get down. Get down.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.701
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende? </i>You too, sit down!

13:50.038 --> 13:51.122
Shit.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.167
I'm back, babe. What's up?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.712
-Walter Jr.
<i>-Yeah, what about him?</i>

13:58.212 --> 14:01.507
-Marijuana. He's smoking it.
<i>-Bullshit.</i>

14:01.674 --> 14:03.885
<i>Excuse me, his own mother</i>
<i>seems to think so.</i>

14:04.052 --> 14:06.012
-Skyler told you that?
<i>-She inferred it.</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:07.513
She inferred it, huh?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.516
She strongly inferred it.

14:10.683 --> 14:16.272
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

14:16.439 --> 14:18.024
<i>-Please, come on.</i>
-All right.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.360
-Talk to him.
<i>-Walt should talk to him.</i>

14:20.526 --> 14:22.528
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.864
<i>I think it ought to be you.</i>

14:25.031 --> 14:27.033
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.952
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.038
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.540
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know...

14:34.707 --> 14:37.919
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.380
Hank, he respects you.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.637
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.556
-Good. Scare him straight.
<i>-Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:52.392
Hey, where's my sugar?

14:57.688 --> 14:58.815
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.235
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.404
I'm extremely clean.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.573
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.578
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.957
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, gray ones.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.960
My manager found them
and we put them back on the floor.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.837
I know.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.136
-What do you think?
-About what?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.638
This look like a nice place?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.641
No, not really.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.852
Think you'd like to live here?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.854
No.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.982
-Sure about that?
-Yeah, pretty sure.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.235
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.988
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.241
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.994
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.914
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.917
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

16:41.083 --> 16:45.087
...who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.757
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.259
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

16:50.426 --> 16:54.764
...miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

16:54.931 --> 16:57.183
-How do you think they started?
-I don't know.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.186
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

17:00.353 --> 17:03.064
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.526
A gateway drug.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.444
That's what we call it.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.030
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not...

17:11.197 --> 17:15.076
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.286
-You understand?
-Yeah.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.540
So why are you telling me this?

17:20.706 --> 17:23.376
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.712
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.466
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.053
You know, just this one time,
you know....

17:34.220 --> 17:37.223
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

17:37.390 --> 17:41.352
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.566
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.238
Check this out.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.490
What I'm talking about.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.994
-I ain't holding, okay?
-Did I say open your mouth?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.079
And hands off the car.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.166
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.255
What's your name, sweetheart?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.258
-Wendy.
-Wendy, huh?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.594
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.972
-I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
-Jesus, was that my question?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.933
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.020
-Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
-Nothing. Neither.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.439
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.483
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.156
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.991
Big-time, big-time on the pipe.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.285
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.120
No, not really.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.456
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

18:43.914 --> 18:46.167
Sausages don't count.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.796
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.800
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.013
-What are you, like, handicapped?
-He broke his leg playing football.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.933
He's a QB. Got an arm like a howitzer.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.146
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.481
Why, you got some?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.317
All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.737
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.537
So, what do you think?

19:25.748 --> 19:26.832
Cool.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.762
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.847
Who the hell was that?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.767
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.228
They ask about me, huh?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.980
No, I think they just wanted pot.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.538
Right there.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.250
Shit, I left my root beer.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.510
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, sweetie, it's me.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.512
Listen, I'm so sorry.

21:03.679 --> 21:08.934
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just....

21:10.102 --> 21:13.939
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

21:14.106 --> 21:16.692
...you know, doing some inventory...

21:16.859 --> 21:19.487
...and I should've just--

21:19.653 --> 21:24.825
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."

21:24.992 --> 21:27.077
But....

21:28.370 --> 21:30.831
Sky? You there?

21:32.208 --> 21:34.335
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:36.962
Yeah.

21:37.671 --> 21:42.718
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

21:48.349 --> 21:52.228
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.855
Quite an earful he gave me.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.734
Listen....

22:00.361 --> 22:02.655
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.659
-I don't think so, Walt.
<i>-Honey....</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
Wherever you are...

22:09.870 --> 22:11.914
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

22:12.122 --> 22:15.251
<i>Skyler? Skyler?</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:18.838
Skyler?

22:20.548 --> 22:22.633
Walter?

22:22.925 --> 22:24.426
Hello?

22:24.635 --> 22:27.429
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.445
Come on.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.886
Damn.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.722
I didn't think you were coming back.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.655
How long was I out?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.574
Ten, 15 minutes?

24:54.576 --> 24:58.247
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.457
You breathe in the same shit
you used on me?

25:09.425 --> 25:10.884
I've got lung cancer.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.120
I'll make you another sandwich.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.825
It's safe.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.828
There's no poison.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.167
Because that would be
the way to do it...

26:25.834 --> 26:27.878
...if you're gonna do it.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.381
I suppose it would.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.008
I mean...

26:33.175 --> 26:35.761
...you being a chemist and all.

26:52.903 --> 26:56.865
So that name...

26:57.241 --> 26:59.493
...Krazy-8.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.870
Do I really have to call you that?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.706
I mean, no offense, but...

27:05.207 --> 27:07.209
...don't you have a real name?

27:08.377 --> 27:10.212
Domingo.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.923
Domingo.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.884
That's "Sunday," right?

27:18.387 --> 27:22.224
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.726
Whatever.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.563
I can't say I ever liked it much.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.777
So, Domingo...

27:33.944 --> 27:37.823
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

27:38.115 --> 27:40.242
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

27:40.409 --> 27:43.453
...is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.747
Not that I mind, you understand?

27:48.292 --> 27:51.837
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.755
Well, maybe.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.091
But maybe not.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.972
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.601
I mean, any good reason at all.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.859
Sell me.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.111
Tell me what it is.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.159
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

28:22.326 --> 28:25.703
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.956
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

28:28.999 --> 28:30.292
...never happened.

28:30.459 --> 28:34.129
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

28:34.838 --> 28:38.508
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.136
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.804
You'll never know for sure.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.977
So, what else can I tell you?

28:54.816 --> 28:56.735
I don't know.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.656
But you've gotta convince me.

29:01.490 --> 29:05.494
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.997
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.500
I'm from here in town, man.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.836
ABQ, born and bred.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.922
Never left.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.842
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

29:21.009 --> 29:22.219
...got my degree.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.180
Really?

29:27.724 --> 29:31.353
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.355
Doesn't hurt.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.900
I was gonna study music originally.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.112
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.573
My pops talked me out of it.

29:43.740 --> 29:47.703
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

29:47.869 --> 29:50.872
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.042
What does your dad do?

29:55.043 --> 29:58.380
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.050
Wait a minute, I know that place.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.471
Wait a minute. That's....

30:06.680 --> 30:09.057
That's that....

30:09.224 --> 30:11.643
They used to have those late-night--

30:11.810 --> 30:14.104
-The stupid commercials.
-That they had, yeah.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.441
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

30:17.607 --> 30:21.320
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was....

30:21.611 --> 30:24.406
Wait, wait, wait. It was....

30:25.574 --> 30:30.120
<i>Don't let shopping</i>
<i>Strain your brain-o</i>

30:30.412 --> 30:34.082
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

30:34.249 --> 30:37.419
<i>-Our furniture is </i>bueno
<i>-Our furniture is</i> bueno

30:37.586 --> 30:41.256
<i>-Tampico is the name-o</i>
<i>-Tampico is the name-o</i>

30:51.767 --> 30:54.811
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

30:54.978 --> 30:58.774
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.694
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.865
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.326
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.873
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven.'"

31:17.042 --> 31:20.128
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I....

31:20.629 --> 31:25.467
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.845
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.305
We did use to sell cribs.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.060
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.396
Yeah. No, I remember that.

31:37.562 --> 31:43.652
In fact, I remember recognizing
your dad from those commercials.

31:43.819 --> 31:47.322
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.408
Yeah. No shit.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.160
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.579
Yeah, he probably did.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.165
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.334
Yeah, that was his big thing.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.169
You ask him for a glass of water...

32:01.336 --> 32:04.339
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.720
-Did you work there too?
-Only my whole life.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.849
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.938
So...

32:21.690 --> 32:24.526
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

32:25.861 --> 32:28.864
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.074
Might have even helped ring you up.

32:31.241 --> 32:35.036
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.714
Small world.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.925
It is.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.888
The paths we take, huh?

33:18.413 --> 33:20.916
Jesse know you've got cancer?

33:23.793 --> 33:25.921
No one but you.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.133
-Not your family?
-No.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.595
Why not?

33:37.265 --> 33:42.187
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.525
That's why you're cooking meth?

33:47.400 --> 33:49.819
You wanna leave money
for your family.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.615
Hell.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.618
I'll write you a check right now
if you let me go.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.459
Like I said, Walter...

34:05.126 --> 34:08.046
...if this line of work
doesn't suit you...

34:12.717 --> 34:15.053
...get out before it's too late.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.853
I don't know what to do.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.446
Yeah.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.240
You do.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.595
I'll get the key.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.281
No.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.367
No.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.286
Oh, no, no, no.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.342
No. No. No, don't do this.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.804
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

37:03.471 --> 37:06.141
Why are you doing this?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.509
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.345
Yeah?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.435
Do you wanna...?

38:05.241 --> 38:09.078
So you're not angry?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.080
What do you mean?

38:11.664 --> 38:13.583
Angry at you?

38:14.167 --> 38:15.710
No.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.213
Live and let live, man.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.550
That's very understanding.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.594
Whatever, man.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.930
I just wanna go home.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.976
Yeah.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.604
Me too.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.489
Unlock me, Walter.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.423
The moment I do...

39:03.925 --> 39:06.928
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

39:35.790 --> 39:37.542
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.627
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.796
I'm so sorry.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.631
I'm sorry.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.557
I'm sorry.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.059
I'm so sorry.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.607
Hello?

41:25.525 --> 41:27.944
Anybody down here?

42:35.303 --> 42:37.388
Everybody...

42:38.347 --> 42:41.017
...I need you all to take your seats.

42:41.184 --> 42:44.020
Settle down, please. Thank you.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.939
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling...

42:47.106 --> 42:49.734
...a little under the weather
this morning.

42:49.901 --> 42:54.906
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

42:55.073 --> 42:59.368
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

42:59.535 --> 43:03.039
...on carbon.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.540
Very important stuff.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.589
-So, what do you think?
-It's a cook site. Gotta be.

43:11.756 --> 43:15.051
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

43:15.218 --> 43:18.054
Fire there could have started
by accident.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.723
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

43:21.390 --> 43:24.769
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

43:24.936 --> 43:28.231
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

43:28.397 --> 43:31.484
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

43:31.651 --> 43:33.402
Yeah. Why not?

43:33.569 --> 43:36.656
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

43:39.951 --> 43:44.914
-Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
-It's a rich and vibrant culture.

43:45.081 --> 43:47.416
It's a car that jumps up and down.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.085
What the hell?

43:49.252 --> 43:52.421
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

43:52.588 --> 43:56.676
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

43:57.093 --> 43:58.636
I already searched it.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.972
Yeah.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.933
You're wasting your time.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.770
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

44:07.937 --> 44:10.606
-...than your dumb white ass to find it.
-Oh, yeah?

44:10.773 --> 44:14.777
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

44:14.944 --> 44:17.280
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.408
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.458
Yeah, baby.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.174
-Hello, zippy.
-Asshole.

44:37.008 --> 44:40.928
Sort of looks like meth,
but it's too damn white.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.183
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

44:45.349 --> 44:48.144
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.812
Hey, agents.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.814
You got something?

45:26.515 --> 45:29.060
<i>I don't know. It just....</i>

45:29.393 --> 45:31.854
It just.... Doesn't it seem like...

45:32.021 --> 45:34.690
...something's missing?

45:34.899 --> 45:37.026
What about the soul?

45:48.537 --> 45:50.915
The soul.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.300
There's nothing but chemistry here.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.284
Skyler?

47:18.002 --> 47:20.671
There's something I have to tell you.
